# This is Your app - own it!

Talk about writing flexible Framework Agnostic code driven by Design Patterns and utilising the magic of TypeScript.

## Abstract
During the Tech Talk, you will learn, among other things: how to navigate the challenges posed by various frameworks and APIs. You will learn the art of crafting manageable, adaptable, and resilient code, irrespective of the underlying framework. You will dive deep into best practices, methodologies, and the art of seamlessly integrating these into your projects, and how to break free from the chains of conventional frameworks.
